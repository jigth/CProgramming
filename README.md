# CProgramming

Short programs to practice and learn some "C programming language" concepts.

## Credits:

Most of the knowledge for the programs done here was gathered from the youtube channel [ShellWave](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp_y-6XZnURs0WR8-7yJZMw). 

The playlist for learning C is available here:
[C Programming in Linux Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKNjXvMB0MY&list=PLypxmOPCOkHXbJhUgjRaV2pD9MJkIArhg)

The main reason for me to select this course was because it looked really complete and the explanations were really easy to follow, understand and apply. Even there's some learning in the context of Linux (not only the C programming language alone).
